    "Q.1> What is a database ? Differenciate between SQL and NoSQL database .\n",
    "Ans> A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and organized in a way that allows \n",
    "     for efficient retrieval and manipulation of information. Databases are commonly used in software \n",
    "     applications to store and manage data, such as customer information, product catalogs, and financial \n",
    "     records.\n",
    "\n",
    "     SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems (DBMSs) that differ in their \n",
    "     approach to organizing and storing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "     SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use tables to organize and store \n",
    "     data. They use a predefined schema to define the structure of the data and enforce data integrity. SQL \n",
    "     databases are typically used for applications that require complex data relationships and transactions, \n",
    "     such as banking systems or e-commerce websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "     NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that use flexible schemas to store and organize \n",
    "     data. They can handle large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data, such as social media data or \n",
    "     sensor data. NoSQL databases are typically used for applications that require high scalability and performance, \n",
    "     such as big data analytics or real-time data processing."

    "Q.2> What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "Ans> DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to create, \n",
    "     modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, and indexes.\n",
    "     CREATE is used to create new database objects, such as tables. For example, to create a new table \n",
    "     named \"customers\" with columns for \"customer_id\", \"customer_name\", and \"customer_email\", you could \n",
    "     use the following SQL statement:\n",

    "     DROP is used to delete existing database objects, such as tables. For example, to delete the \"customers\" \n",
    "     table, you could use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "     DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "     \n",
    "    ALTER is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or deleting columns \n",
    "    from a table. For example, to add a new column named \"customer_phone\" to the \"customers\" table, you could \n",
    "    use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "      ALTER TABLE customers\n",
    "      ADD customer_phone VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "        \n",
    "    TRUNCATE is used to delete all the data from a table, but the table structure remains intact. This is useful \n",
